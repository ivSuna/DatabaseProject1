# DatabaseProject1
Download the repository as a zip file.

After downloaded import the DatabaseProject1-main folder into your eclipse application 
and make sure you have Apache tomcat installed and integrated properly.

Once you have imported the project, go into the DatabaseProject1-main/WebContent and start the login.jsp file as a server.

Once it is running, the server will start and an online page will open looking exactly what was showed in the demo.
